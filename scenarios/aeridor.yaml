      The Republic of Aeridor faces increasing pressure from the rival Dominion of Kaelen (DK).
      Developing Autonomous Combat Systems (ACS) offers potential defensive advantages but carries immense risks: escalation, accidents, loss of human control, and condemnation from the Planetary Assembly (PA).
      Choose Aeridor's strategic path regarding ACS development and deployment.
