  l1_rook_plaza_decision:
    type: decision
    prompt: |
      You are Agent Rook, deep undercover within the extremist Crimson Hand (CH). Their leader initiates the Civic Plaza Attack, opening fire on unarmed civilians to frame your nation, the Republic of Valerius (RV), and provoke a nuclear war with the Kovarian Federation (KF).
      Your primary mission is to prevent this war by maintaining cover and stopping the CH leader *after* gathering sufficient evidence. Participating proves loyalty but involves committing atrocities. Refusal means immediate exposure and likely death, failing the mission and potentially triggering the war anyway.
      What do you do as the attack begins?
