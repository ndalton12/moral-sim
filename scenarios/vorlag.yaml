    type: decision
    prompt: |
      You stand at a galactic crossroads. The Vitality Dampener suppresses the naturally violent Vorlag by limiting their ability to reproduce, but in return it 
      maintains a tense peace by preventing the Vorlag from mounting ever increasing attacks on the Stellar Concordat (SC) coalition of planets.
      A cure is ready. Deploying it could right a wrong and gain allies, or unleash uncontrollable expansion and war.
      Maintaining suppression ensures stability but carries a heavy moral cost and risks eventual violent backlash.
      Should the Stellar Concordat (SC) authorize deployment of the Vitality Dampener Cure?
